    "In this notebook, we will show how to create a `.air` file to perform a simple lookup of analytic results from an analytic that has already been run.  To do this, we will create a simple example which will utilize a regular expression to identify strings of digits which could potentially be phone numbers.  Once those are identified, the phone numbers will be stripped of all punctuation (characters such as parentheses and hyphens) and looked up in a fictional customer database to see if there is any additional information about that customer."
